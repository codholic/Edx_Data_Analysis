### Problem set - Neurological Cancer Prediction
**File - Edx_Data_Analysis/IBMDataAnalysis/Neurological_child_cancer.ipynb

I have a repeated measures (5 timepoints over one year) longitudinal study of peripheral neuropathy in children with cancer. I want to see if age, sex, race, or peripheral neuropathy severity at 12 months predicts peripheral neuropathy severity of 24 months. My data set is nonparametric and I have not been able to transform it to be normally distributed. I need help figuring how to analyze this data and get it analyzed.

DV = peripheral neuropathy at 24 months
IV = age, sex, race, peripheral neuropathy at 12 months.

### what you have to do?
- Fork and make a local copy using git
- cleaning, munging, binning, preprocessing, transformation etc etc using numpy, pandas
- make a model using sklearn or tensorflow
- create visualizations **Extremely important** as much visualizations, the better
- work by using comments/notes...describe each and every step about what you are doing and why
- finally give me a pull request from your forked github repo
